# Report
Internship Report

- A front cover page that conforms to the cover template on Canvas

- A description of the internship organisation (including, for example, an
organisational chart), a description of the internship itself (a kind of job
description), the job description of the external supervisor and the position of
the student within the organisation, including the length of the internship and
the number of hours per week. Write this in your own words and stick to the
facts; make sure it does not become too much of an ‘advertisement’ for the
organisation or department.

- A description of the assignment and the methodological knowledge and
academic skills you applied to it. Often, students will also have to provide a
written report of the assignment to the internship organisation. You can
include such a report in the appendices. The internship report must make clear
what your concrete contribution was to the assignment and how you applied
which theoretical knowledge and academic skills.

- A description of any other activities in which you participated and any results
